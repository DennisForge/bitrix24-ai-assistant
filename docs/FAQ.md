### Can I use the application without AI features?

Yes, you can disable AI features by setting `AI_ENABLED=False` in your `.env` file. The application will work perfectly without AI functionality.

## Troubleshooting

### The application won't start

**Common causes:**
- Missing dependencies: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Database connection issues: Check your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
- Redis connection issues: Ensure Redis is running and `REDIS_URL` is correct
- Missing environment variables: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure

### Bitrix24 integration isn't working

**Check these items:**
- Webhook URL format: Should be `https://your-domain.bitrix24.com/rest/1/your-key/`
- API permissions: Ensure webhook has required permissions (CRM, Calendar, Tasks, Users)
- Network connectivity: Test if you can reach Bitrix24 API from your server
- Webhook status: Verify the webhook is active in Bitrix24

### Tasks or events aren't syncing

**Troubleshooting steps:**
1. Check the logs in `logs/app.log`
2. Verify Bitrix24 API credentials
3. Check network connectivity
4. Ensure the scheduler service is running
5. Try manual sync from the dashboard

### Email notifications aren't working

**Common issues:**
- SMTP settings: Verify `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_USERNAME`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`
- Authentication: Use app passwords for Gmail, not regular passwords
- Firewall: Ensure SMTP ports are not blocked
- TLS/SSL: Check `EMAIL_USE_TLS` setting

### Database connection errors

**Solutions:**
- Verify database server is running
- Check database credentials in `DATABASE_URL`
- Ensure database exists and user has permissions
- Test connection manually using database client

### High memory usage

**Optimization steps:**
- Reduce `DATABASE_POOL_SIZE` in `.env`
- Adjust `SCHEDULER_MAX_WORKERS`
- Enable database query optimization
- Monitor log file sizes and enable rotation

## API and Development

### Is there an API documentation?

Yes, when running in debug mode (`APP_DEBUG=True`), you can access interactive API documentation at:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

### Can I extend the application?

Absolutely! The application is built with extensibility in mind:
- Add new API endpoints in `app/api/endpoints/`
- Create new services in `app/services/`
- Add new models in `app/models/`
- Extend the frontend in `frontend/` and `static/`

### How do I contribute to the project?

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Submit a pull request

See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed information.

### Are there any rate limits?

Yes, the application includes rate limiting:
- Default: 100 requests per minute per IP
- Configure with `API_RATE_LIMIT` and `API_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` in `.env`
